| Weeks | Goal |
| --- | --- | 
| 01 = 15/06/2020   | Results for Doc2Vec + packet meta information for cic-ids-2017 dataset | 
| 02   | Presentation; Use proposal as first draft for thesis |
| 03 | Generate Network Flows from raw pcaps |
| 04   | Generate features from Netflows |
| 06-07 | Write thesis sections about doc2vec/word2vec embeddings, one-class svm, LOF, Network flow generation, netflow feature extraction, cic-ids-2017 dataset |
| 08-09   | (buffer) |
| 09-10 | Include 2nd dataset (UNSWB-2015) |
| 11-13 | Include usage of CNN as Deep Learning method |
| 14-16 | Include and evaluate usage of Deep Autoencoders or other approach |
| 17 | Evaluate if IDS-2018 can be used as well (problems: big size, labelling of packets) |
| 18 | Choose evaluation setup (which feature extractors, transformers, ...) and start evaluations |
| 19-20 | Write thesis sections about: Deep Learning approaches, other included datasets, evaluation setup |
| 21 | Discuss and compare evaluation results |
| 23 | Software testing, check correctness of evaluation results |
